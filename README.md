# University-maintenance-application
This is an application which has the ability to maintain the records of university studentâ€™s marks. This application could use to register new students or lectures to the current university database as well. This application is based on C# and ASP.net. As well as I have used SQL to maintain the database.

When it comes to the designing part of this application this has been developed with N-tier software architecture, which has its presentation, application processing, and data management functions are physically separated to reach best performance and user friendliness.  

I used Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and Microsoft SQL Server Management studio to develop this application 

This project has been completed by me (Dilum De Silva) as the first task during my summer internship(2017).
